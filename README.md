DESCRIPTION

Individual Gitbooks covering programming mind-maps, competencies, and foundational knowledge.

CONTEXT

Synthesizing new knowledge from past projects will deepen our understanding of things we've learned. Good code quality is essential to becoming a world-class engineer, and this project will pay special atttention to it. Your Gitbook should also provide you with a clear mind map of the purposes and relationships of various programming languages.

SPECIFICATIONS

General:
- [ ] Each group member has their own "Learning To Code" gitbook
- [ ] Using your deeper understanding of code, push one new commit to each of your past projects.
- [ ] Each group member gives a Ted Talk presenting something from your Gitbook.
 
Each Gitbook includes:
- [ ] Some shared structure, but the content is different to reflect individual thought
- [ ] Your own list (or better yet, mindmap) of programming competencies
- [ ] Review of your last four projects and which of those competencies you learned
- [ ] Review a sample of your code from each of your past projects, dissected and re-written at higher quality. 
- [ ] An account of tangible skills you can perform without help at the beginning of the week, and again at the end.
- [ ] A chapter on non-technical aspects of programming (project management, group dynamics, productivity, workflow)
- [ ] At least five further chapters on specific programming languages or practices you have learned
