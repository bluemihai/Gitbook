From Shereef:
- [ ] http://competency-checklist.appspot.com (not specific to web developer, but relevant)
- [ ] http://www.theodinproject.com (ruby on rails but lots of stuff applies to all web development)
- [ ] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn (incomplete, but a decent effort)
- [ ] http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/concepts/general_programming (don't skip over the programming parts)
- [ ] http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly (pretty opinionated, I like it!)
- [ ] https://bento.io/grid (great grid of resources, and a decent table of contents. The content is open sourced here:
- [ ] https://github.com/bento-io/collection/blob/gh-pages/content.json and here: https://github.com/bento-io/matrix)
- [ ] https://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/Main_Page (good overview table of contents)
